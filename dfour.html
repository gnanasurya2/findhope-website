                We can't say that our Life will always be a clear path because sometimes life throws obstacles in our
                path but it depends totally on us whether we stop there or try to find a new path.
                <br><br>
                My school phase went on very smoothly.
                Coming to my intermediate, in the first year I got 465 out of 470 in state exam and I was on cloud 9. I
                worked hard the same way in my second year but unfortunately I just got 954 out of 1000 in second year
                and I spoke not a word with my friends and teachers. I somehow managed to go and tell my parents, I
                reached home and stood infront of my mom as I spoke about my marks I tried to laugh but eventually I
                knew it wouldn't last.
                At that point i broke out i cried alot that even my parents got frightened. The main problem was I was
                very stressed as my JEE exams was right around the corner. With 2 days left to it my self esteem plunged
                down and I was getting panic attacks. I knew that this might have effected my jee exam.
                My parents helped me out and I did get introduced to mindfulness and meditation.
                The situation passed and Now I am persuaing B.Tech in Nit Patna in Ece department.
                <br><br>
                At that situation my parents backed me that they have belief in me and told me that i can achieve
                more..My teachers and friends encouraged me in the same way
                <br><br>
                So as i said at the start, Life throws some obstacles in our path , it doesn't mean it's a dead end...
                It is just a challenge whether we are dare enough to choose another path or make our own way...
