                Being diagnosed with Atopic dermatitis and one of the Oppressive-Compulsive & Related disorders back in
                school life. I had to giveup taking dance lessons and abstain myself from any water activity. Stuffed
                with medications, things were in the clear now. However, at the end of my first year in college, my
                medicines stopped working and started affecting my already high myopic eyesight. In a span of just 30
                days, the dermatitis had spread all over my body and I had to stop going to classes or even step out for
                any reason. Considering how all the previous treatments had failed, I was determined enough to continue
                this homeopathic therapy irrespective of the countless sleepless nights, depression, suicide attempts,
                and mental trauma. Somehow I gave my finals and pushed myself to join college again.<br><br>
                It's 3 years now, and even though the therapy ultimately failed due to severe infection that made me
                bedridden for 2 weeks, got hospitalized for severe asthama, just got saved from frying up my kidneys due
                to sever staphylococcus infection and had compelled me to shift back to heavier allopathic medications,
                but what matters the most is that- I am alive and enjoying the little bonbons of whatever happiness
                comes to me. <br><br>On that night of July, 2017, I decided to live again. I owe this to my family who
                despite
                their very tight schedule pick out time to give me the extra care needed, my four close friends, and
                partly to me as well.
                For me what helped was maintaining a journal, blogging, dancing, and handful of amazing humans in form
                of friends and family. Depression comes in cycles, and I still have my bad days when I lock myself in,
                scribble randomly or distance myself from people, but the hope of getting through the storm helps me to
                walk on the tightropes. Medicated living, yes. But I am not giving up. Neither should you. So to Atopic
                dermatitis & OCD, I going to run; and guess what, you're losing.
