                I belong from a nuclear family and being a single child I have always been pampered by my parents since
                childhood. They have always kept me in a cocoon that assured confort level at its best. I have always
                had problems regarding anxiety and breathlessness but neither my parents nor me took them at a serious
                level. <br><br>
                In class 11, I came in a relationship that I can say was very close to my heart. I shifted to Bangalore
                for my undergraduate degree, away from my parents resulting in a long distance relationship as well. The
                big new city didn't really welcome me well lifestyles of people here are completely different. I started
                secluding myself from everything. Gradually I would see myself crying at the end of each day, not able
                to sleep at night due to regular panick attacks, sit quietly throughout the day in class, I even stopped
                communicating properly with my parents and had regular fights in my relationship. <br><br>
                I was assigned a therapist who diagnosis me with Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Stress
                Disorder and a very low serotonin level in my body. I started taking antidepressants. Life wasn't easy
                still. Then I fractured my ankle. i was confined to bed for 45 days following which, I had to attend my
                end semester exams and complete an internship in that devastated state of mind. I was completely broken.
                Life felt meaningless. I started having rigorous panick attacks everyday and would break down in tears
                then and now. <br><br>
                Just before Diwali, I lost my grandmother who was extremely close to me. I started fearing death every
                sec and had several sleepless nights.But then I had my therapist, my best friend and my roommate who
                took care of me each and every second, I slowly shared everything with my parents and that was the best
                decision ever. It's due to the regular therapies, and constant support from everyone that 6 months have
                passed and I have been able to adjust with my college pretty well. Mental health is as normal as any
                other body disease. Antidepressants shouldn't be labelled as drugs. They are as common as paracetamol
                taken during fevers.
