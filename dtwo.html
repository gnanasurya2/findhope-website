                I was a confident boy during admission into a college and I was with full dedication towards studys and
                attending lectures and initially got good grades and in no time become a teacher’s favourite. I made few
                new friends who although were trying to pull my leg by asking me that I should get slim, improve my
                dressing sense, not apply oil on hairy, study less but all these stuff got into my head and I started
                bunking lectures, took studies casually. <br><br>
                Most of the time I used to chill with them and not study, watched movies. I still remember one night
                before 1st sem exam (maths) I was helping my friends with their queries as I had prepared well but as
                there were around 40 formulas which I didn't practice and thought will do it later, time was less but
                work was more the whole night I kept practicing formulas and slept for just 1.5 hours. During exam I
                couldn’t attempt more than 2 questions which would fetch me 24 marks and passing I had to get 35 and I
                thought all the more if I attempt half part of one question I will get 30 but 35 is impossible, just
                after my eyes kept weeping & I left the exam hall within half the time and decided to quit college .
                <br><br> It
                was a shocking /horrifying day for me as I had never-ever failed in academics but now I would. As we
                have all exams in one week so after my exam I called my mother and told her everything and said I want
                to come back home and take a drop out. She somehow convinced me and brought back hope.
                Without any await, I was prepared for results and I got exactly 24 marks I thought and failed the exam,
                then I went back to college attended lectures, took my studies seriously and developed a healthy
                lifestyle overall and topped the exam which I failed.
                What I learned is that don’t let the environment change you so much that power of soul from within
                starts vanishing and if at all you encounter failure ,cry for sometime but then first diagnose the
                reason behind it and start improving and let your brain, heart and actually every single cell of your
                body work in co-relation towards it what you dreamt off .
