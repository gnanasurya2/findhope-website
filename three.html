                I lost my little brother to suicide on 6th January, 2019. He was only 18 years old. It was very sudden,
                shocking and happened when we least expected it. The days that followed were hard, it was the darkest
                phase of my life. There was trauma, there was grief, there was anger and I was an ugly mix of emotions.
                It's a feeling you just can't describe, I was full yet felt so empty. I remember praying, I'd go to bed
                hoping for a sign and then I just stopped sleeping altogether. I wouldn't sleep for weeks at a time and
                would cry uncontrollably. <br><br> There was this one time when I experienced a severe panic attack in
                the middle
                of the night, I couldn't move, I couldn't speak. I just wept, with my mum right next to me. I wouldn't
                wish this upon anyone. I eventually told my parents that it was too much and I wanted to get better.
                This is when my parents took me to a doctor and I was diagnosed with Anxiety, PTSD and insomnia. I've
                been on meds ever since and I can safely say that I'm in a much better place now. <br><br> I'm still
                learning to
                deal with my grief and coming to terms with my reality, a life without my brother but I am blessed with
                a very supportive and loving family and some amazing friends. They've helped me get better. Another
                thing that has helped is finding meaning in my loss. I am now running various campaigns and giving talks
                on mental health awareness and suicide prevention. It's the need of the hour. And to be completely
                honest, Raghav isn't truly gone. He's still here, guiding me from above. Giving me strength to do
                everything that I'm doing right now.
