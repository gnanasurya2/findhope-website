                There was a time in my life when I had started to lose interest in most of the activities and things
                around me. Episodes of feeling lonely and disconnected were getting common. There would be times I would
                cry for no reason. I'd wake up with anxiety, and on some days I'd just lay in my bed tired but unable to
                sleep. I would constantly overthink and go in a downward spiral. This had reached a point where I
                decided to see a psychiatrist, the acceptance of the fact that there is something wrong with me and is
                beyond my ability to deal was hard at first but I had a friend who just stood by me like a pillar no
                matter what and honestly It's because of her I was able to see through this dark tunnel that my life was
                turning into and seek some light. So anyway, from there started my journey to fix myself. <br><br> I've
                gotten a
                lot better in dealing with my anxiety and have accepted it as a part of who I am. Every Once in a while
                I'll get thoughts that would make me really anxious, initially I used to give in to these thoughts and
                let them control me, but overtime I have managed to let go of these thoughts and just let them pass
                without any judgement. I think the solution for any mental health related issue comes from accepting it
                and talking about it, but we live in a society where it is still a taboo to talk about such issues.
                People are often afraid of being judged so they choose to suffer in silence. After realising how common
                this problem is, I decided to turn my struggle into art and inspire more and more people to look inwards
                and make sure that their mental health is not compromised. I started a podcast to help people get
                through their struggle and find the support that they might not be getting from family or friends.
                <br><br> The
                lows that I've been through during these past few months have made me a stronger person. It has led me
                on a journey of working on my own self that would never have happened if it wasn't for my beloved
                depression and anxiety.
