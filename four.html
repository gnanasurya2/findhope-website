                For years I've been dealing with deep seated fear, anxiety, insecurity, and a sense of hopelessness that
                lasts for days even weeks. Back in school I had been bullied for who I was, teachers weren't supportive
                enough, classmates mocked me for my inability to make friends and honestly things weren't much better at
                home either. Part of which I prefer to call it a house than a home. I've been abused as a kid, both
                physically and mentally and it was years later when I came to Delhi for Higher Education. My childhood
                has been ruined by then. Sort of Post Traumatic fear still haunt me after years. In the first year of my
                college I constantly had to break my own barriers that I once made out of fear, I had to put myself in
                situations I wasn't comfortable in, just because I wanted to escape my comfort zone. There were multiple
                occasions where I had to run out of college crying because I was too afraid to cry in Public. Fearing
                that everything I do here, will recreate school for me. I didn't have enough friends to confide in.
                <br><br>Once I tried to tell a friend that I feel I am depressed. Her reaction was something I wasn't
                expecting. She
                told me "How exactly do you think you are depressed. We all are. Stop doing it. It's wrong". So I
                completely forced myself to keep things inside. People break down. And it's okay. Mental Health should
                be our first priority, and it doesn't matter if you've opted for a therapy or not as long as you
                surround yourself with people who understand you & look after you when you need them the most. I am
                looking out for help, therapy through conversations or whatever it takes for almost two years now.
                <br><br> I am
                coming out with each new day. I am not ashamed to be mentally ill rather I am happy & proud to be vocal
                about my emotions and problems. I am grateful that I write. I am a writer and I give words to unspoken
                emotions and unheard stories.
