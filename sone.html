                And I couldn't play my part because I was unaware of the Idea of mental health.Before that, I have never
                felt what loneliness is and I started self analysing myself, which again depends on what do you know,
                what is your story, how much you know about other's stories. Through that self analysis I realized that
                I was happy earlier because I was expressing myself through art and writing and I was expressing only my
                happiness.I cared of what people will think if I start expressing my sorrows and gloom because . I never
                presented my self as an emotional being, but that one death changed it for me. Made me realize how
                important it is to express. No matter how good or bad you are at singing, writing, painting, talking. No
                matter how big you are at it. No matter what your audience size is. You can express it to one person you
                can express it to a crowd of thousands. But, we are a vessel of feelings and the vessel needs to be
                emptied again and again to make room for more. And yes you have the freedom to think that no one will
                resonate with your thoughts, you are free to feel feared of rejection, but at the same time you are free
                to be angry and you are free to express. Love seeking is not a sin. People may give you various tags for
                it, but it is their story their learning their life events.
