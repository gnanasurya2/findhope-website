                I always wanted to be a forensic expert so I chose to study BSc Forensic but life had another path in
                store,my parents thought it will be better off with a BSC Human physiology. The transition was hard, one
                side
                I had a yearning heart and another side, my parents, both were important, this took a toll on me and I
                went through a mental breakdown when I had to sacrifice my dream course and settle for something less.
                <br><br> I
                did talk with my parents, we sometimes had arguments but I could understand the financial pressures. I
                made my mind and joined a University as a student of Bsc Physiology, It was not yet over, I was advised
                to attend another University and I did it only to regret later. The new University had a very bad
                community so it started affecting me mentally and physically. It was a fix, I was stuck and didn't know
                what to do so, I took some time and talked to those very few whom I could lean on. It's true that I had
                no chance to pursue what I wanted so, I chose the best of what I had at my expose and returned to the
                previous University. I could have pushed my parents to pay the expensive Course I wanted but It would be
                of no use. <br><br> Some times we settle not Because we want to but because of its right. I am
                definitely going
                to chase my dream again after bachelor's its just this time gap between us. <br><br>
                Don't give up, sometimes we have to settle for less, it's fine and it's not the end only if we don't
                give up.
